<h1>Introduction</h1>
  <body>When many of us here the word "microbe", there is a tendency to immediately think of disease. 
    This is quite understandable, with the current pandemics of numerous viruses and the threat of anitbiotic resistant bacteria becoming more and more prevelant, the most obvious interaction the majority of us have with microbes revolves around the harm they can cause.
    However, viewing the relationship between microbes and humans solely through the lens of diseases paints an extrodanarily incomplete picture of this relationship.
    Simply put, life on this planet as a whole would not be possible without the existance of microbes. 
    One of the most critical components of the building blocks of life is nitrogen, and is abundent on Earth in gaseous form.
    However, in order to be actually utalized by organisms to sustain life, nitrogen must be in a solid form.
    Unless that is, you are a nitrogen fixing bacteria.
    These bacteria play the absolutely critical role of extracting gaseous nitrogen from the Earth's atmosphere and converting it into a solid form that may be utilized by other organisms.
    On the topic of crucial gases present in the Earth's atmosphere, if you were to guess where most of the oxygen you breath comes from, you would most likely say "trees."
    The truth however, is that oceanic phytoplankton responsible for nearly 70% of the oxygen you breath!
    The critical roles microbes play in sustaining life on this planet, along with their outlandish abilities give microbes an intriguing charm that I hope this website will help demonstrate.
